# ToDoApp

- I have created user interface app to help the used to create a reminders with an easy navigation function. The user able to create reminders as a to do list for their activities. The user able to edit add and delete reminders from the main page of user interface.

- I have planned the app into three different parts,
Where they will work along side each otherâ€™s.

- I created 4 different screens that I will be using them together then planned each function along with it. I have created buttons to act upon request from the function. Along the process I was testing each function throughout the development. My functions was to add, delete, delete all and edit

- In future some of the functions I wish to participate is create an alert to remind the user to achieve there list with a a time set alongside notification to keep the user up to date

- I was really excited when I have connected all the screens together and saw my code working successfully it was a new skill that I have developed alongside my training. Also that the buttons respond with a successful result
